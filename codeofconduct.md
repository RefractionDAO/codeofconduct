We do not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, economic background, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, age, nationality, religion, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, or other markers of identity. 

RefractionDAO expects members, contributors, volunteers, and participants to support each other in upholding the Code of Conduct and co-creating an inclusive environment.

### **Goals of the Code**

The goal of this Code of Conduct is to (1) sustain a community where members, contributors, volunteers, and participants feel welcome, comfortable, and respected showing up as their full selves and (2) be explicit about a process for how we engage with one another and hold each other accountable.

##### **Expected Standards**

- Building a community grounded in care, connection, and support so that our work together in art and music is an opportunity for collective healing.  
- Being accountable for the impact of our words and actions on others in spite of our intent. 
- Leading with empathy, generosity, and reciprocity. 
- Engaging in open, honest, and authentic dialogue to build community and foster collaboration.
- Assuming good faith by giving the benefit of the doubt and asking for clarity when in doubt.  
- Treating others with dignity and respect at all times. 
- Gracefully accepting different perspectives, attitudes, and expressions.
- Addressing and disclosing inappropriate behavior and comments that are discriminatory, harassing, abusive, offensive, or unwelcome.

##### **Unacceptable Behavior**
- Lack of professionalism that creates an unproductive, hostile, discriminatory, or uncomfortable environment online or offline including: 
    * Intimidation, bullying, aggression, dishonest, or threatening language or behavior. 
    * Unwillingness to engage in conversations about conflict in a respectful and cordial manner. 
    * Excessive criticism, disparagement, or negativity that undermines the work of Refraction, its contributors, members, or volunteers. 
    * Engagement in activities where one’s personal interests conflict with the interests and well-being of Refraction, its contributors, members, or volunteers.

- Verbal, physical, or written forms of harassment or violence including: 
    * Sexual harassment defined as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or any other verbal or physical (including visual) conduct of a sexual nature. 
    * Implicit or explicit verbal or written statements related to sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, ethnicity, race, religion, nationality, age, physical appearance, neuro(a)typicality.  
    * Verbal: sexual innuendos, racial or sexual epithets, derogatory slurs, propositions, threats, or suggestive or insulting sounds. 
    * Visual: derogatory posters, emails, texts, faxes, cartoons, or drawings; suggestive objects or pictures; graphic commentaries; leering; or obscene gestures; use of inappropriate websites. 
    * Physical: unwanted physical contact including touching, interference with an individual’s normal work movement, or assault. 
    * Making threats of reprisals or violence of any kind, especially as a result of a negative response to an unwelcome sexual advance or other prohibited conduct; taking related action with respect to any contributor, member, or volunteer based on the discriminatory factors described above.  
- Violations of privacy or “doxing”, including publication of private communication (e.g. screenshots of personal exchanges) or private personal information (e.g. name, location, identifying details).
- Disregard for pronouns and gender-affirming names. 
- Using bots or other programs to maliciously manipulate the Refraction community through scam, spam, or solicitation.

### **Scope of the Code**

**This Code of Conduct applies to all members, contributors, and volunteers in all spaces managed by RefractionDAO.**

This includes, but is not limited to, Refraction’s Discord server, email, Telegram IRL events, Metaverse spaces, and software or platforms used for Refraction projects. 

Violations of this Code of Conduct in spaces outside of those described may also impact a person’s ability to participate in, work with, contribute to, or volunteer with Refraction. 

### **Code Enforcement**

#### Community Responsibility and Accountability

If you witness or experience a violation of this Code of Conduct, Refraction urges you to report the violation to the Conflict Resolution Committee through our reporting [form](https://airtable.com/shrpKDiuK3n2l13ZL). The form does not require you to reveal your identity. 

If you have been accused of a Code of Conduct violation, Refraction encourages you to reflect upon the impact of your actions (beyond your intentions). If you receive consequences based on a Code of Conduct violation, Refraction urges you to consider meaningful ways to learn and repair harm that has occurred. Refraction takes action to (1) prioritize safety, (2) reduce conflict, and (3) create opportunities for transformative justice where possible based on the needs of those harmed and the community at large. 

#### Conflict Resolution Committee

Refraction’s Conflict Resolution Committee consists of self-organized members of teams across Refraction Guilds. The Committee is responsible for reviewing each report and making decisions about appropriate enforcement of the Code, including consequences.

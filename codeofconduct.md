Refraction DAO expects members, contributors, volunteers, and participants to support each other in upholding the Code of Conduct and co-creating an inclusive environment.

### **Goals of the Code**

The goal of this Code of Conduct is to (1) sustain a community where members, contributors, volunteers, and participants feel welcome, comfortable, and respected showing up as their full selves and (2) be explicit about a process for how we engage with one another and hold each other accountable.

##### **Expected Standards**

- Being accountable for the impact of our words & actions on others in spite of our intent. 
- Leading with empathy, generosity, and reciprocity. 
- Engaging in open, honest, and authentic dialogue to build community and foster collaboration.
- Assuming good faith by giving the benefit of the doubt and asking for clarity when in doubt.  
- Treating others with dignity and respect at all times. 
- Gracefully accepting different perspectives, attitudes, and expressions.
- Addressing and disclosing inappropriate behavior and comments that are discriminatory, harassing, abusive, offensive, or unwelcome.

    * Excessive criticism, disparagement, or negativity that undermines the work of Refraction, its contributors, members, or volunteers.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all members, contributors, and volunteers in all spaces managed by Refraction DAO.**

This includes, but is not limited to, Refraction’s Discord server, email, Telegram IRL events, Metaverse spaces, and software or platforms used for Refraction projects. 

Violations of this Code of Conduct in spaces outside of those described may also impact a person’s ability to participate in, work with, contribute to, or volunteer with Refraction. 

### **Code Enforcement**

#### Community Responsibility and Accountability

If you witness or experience a violation of this Code of Conduct, Refraction urges you to report the violation to the Conflict Resolution Committee through our reporting [form](https://airtable.com/shrpKDiuK3n2l13ZL). The form does not require you to reveal your identity. 

If you have been accused of a Code of Conduct violation, Refraction encourages you to reflect upon the impact of your actions (beyond your intentions). If you receive consequences based on a Code of Conduct violation, Refraction urges you to consider meaningful ways to learn and repair harm that has occurred. Refraction takes action to (1) prioritize safety, (2) reduce conflict, and (3) create opportunities for transformative justice where possible based on the needs of those harmed and the community at large.
